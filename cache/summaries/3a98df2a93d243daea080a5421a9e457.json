      "move": "c5",
      "reason": "Black played c5, allowing White to maintain a strong pawn on e5 and control the center without much opposition. It also weakens the d5 square.",

      "reason": "The move e6 did not capitalize on the opportunity to resolve the central tension and allowed White to consolidate. It also blocks the bishop on f8.",
