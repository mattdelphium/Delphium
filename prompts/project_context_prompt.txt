Prompt to Resume Delphium Chess Analyzer Project:

I'm working on a chess analysis tool called Delphium. It fetches my games from Chess.com, runs Stockfish to analyze them, and uses OpenAI (GPT-4o) to summarize individual games and identify overall patterns.

The project is structured with modules like fetch/chesscom.py, analyzer/stockfish.py, and analyzer/summariser.py. I use prompts/single_game_prompt.txt and prompts/global_summary_prompt.txt for prompt templates. There's a .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY and CHESS_USERNAME.

I've already got it working end-to-end — fetching games, analyzing them, caching results, and generating summaries.

I'm now ready to move on to the next phase, which might include:

Improving the output formatting (e.g. markdown or HTML)

Exporting summaries to file

Adding a local web UI

Batch uploading PGNs

Scheduling runs

Or anything else to make the tool more useful or polished.

Please continue with good code structure and clear separation of concerns. Assume I’m using Python 3.11+ and VS Code on Ubuntu.
